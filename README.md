# Olaa, Welcome to Corban's GitHub Profile! 👋

Hey there, I'm ** Corban Mwihia** 🚗 visionary. Creative. Ambitious.

I'm a Computer Science student who's dead serious about using tech to solve real problems — like improving education systems by implementing AI. By day, I build apps   that actually matter And simultanously sharpen my other skills such as photogrphy and Editing .

This GitHub is where my ideas come to life — from AI-powered Education assistant to experimental side quests. If it makes life easier or smarter, you'll probably find it here.
